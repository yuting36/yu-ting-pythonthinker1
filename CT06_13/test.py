# #Task 1
# # Print numbers from 10 to 200 using the while loop
# # Your numbers must be in multiples of 10.
# # 10 must be first number printed, and 200 the last number.

# # Example: 10, 20, 30 ..... 180, 190, 200.
# # Note that the numbers do not need to be printed in one line.
# # Write your code here

# num = 10          
# while num <= 200: #loop it :D
#     print(num)    # print the number
#     num += 10     # make it the multiples of 10

# # Task 2
# # Code a password checker to protect your code!

# # Assign a password "superpass123" to a variable
# # Ask the user to enter a password
# # If the password matches, print “Access Granted”
# # If the password does not match, print “Access Denied”

# # Write your code here

# password = "superpass123" # the password
# user_pass = str(input("What is the password?  ")) # ask user to input password

# if user_pass == password:
#     print("Access Granted")
# else :print("Access Denied")

# Basic List Functions
# Do the following operations to the list provided below
# Write the code below each question.

planets = ["mercury","venus", "earth", "mars", "jupiter", "saturn", "uranus" ]

# 1. Write code below to print the 3rd item 
#    in this list using index e.g. earth

print(planets[2])


# 2. Write code to append neptune to this list.

planets.append("neptune")

# 3. Elon Musk has conquered Mars. 
#    Rename Mars in the list to be "muskworld"

planets.pop([3] , "muskworld")

# 4. Remove uranus from this list.


# 5. Using a for loop, print all the planets 
#    from this list one by one.
